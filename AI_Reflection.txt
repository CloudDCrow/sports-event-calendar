Parts that used AI:

	For this project I did not use AI for the first steps of the project.
	Due to my lack of time and not yet being fluent in PHP,
	I used AI during the final stages of the project to check if my PHP code
	is written to standards.
	
	So my files in src/php/... were not generated, but written with the help of AI.

	No code was copied or pasted into any AI model, I asked it to showcase a standard
	way to write the PHP queries and used that template on my own code.
	I could have used different ways to do this, for example documentations or forums,
	but decided to ask an AI model to save time.

One Improvement:

	I would have liked to create a filter to only show certain parts of the calendar,
	for example if a person only wanted to see the upcoming volleyball games,
	so that they wouldn't have to see irrelevant information about other sports.
